# Leftover Ingredients App
This app helps you find meals for your leftover ingredients. Type in your leftover ingredient to view recipes you can make!
Each recipe contains the instructions along with a link to the corresponding YouTube video.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I focused on creating a responsive website that accesses TheMealDB, a crowd-sourced database of recipes from around the world.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would add search filters to specify vegetarian or vegan recipes. 

## Lessons Learned

I gained knowledge with accessing an open database to retrieve useful information for the user as well as adjusting the dimension of background images for changing screen sizes.
